<PRE>Kozhikode is a coastal city in the south Indian state of Kerala. 
It was a significant spice trade center and is close to Kappad Beach,
where Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama landed in 1498. The central 
Kozhikode Beach, overlooked by an old lighthouse, is a popular spot 
for watching the sunset. Inland, tree-lined Mananchira Square, 
with its musical fountain,surrounds the massive Mananchira Tank, an artificial pond.
